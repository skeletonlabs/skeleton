<p class="type-scale-5">Skeleton supports a variety of web-based frameworks and meta-frameworks, so we've created the following guide to serve as a universal reference when implementing page layouts. These techniques utilize native HTML and Tailwind, meaning Skeleton is supported but not required.</p>

## Real World Example

See our real world three column example, which implements many of the concepts introduced below.

<figure class="card-enhanced-gradient flex justify-center p-8">
	<a
		class="btn preset-filled"
		href="https://play.tailwindcss.com/zP9RcoacIS"
		target="_blank"
	>
		View Real World Example &rarr;
	</a>
</figure>

## Semantic Markup

When creating custom layouts, it's recommended to use semantic HTML to denote each region of the page.

| Element | Description | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<header>` | Represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.| [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header)  |
| `<main>` | Represents the dominant content within the document `<body>`. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application. | [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main) |
| `<footer>` | Represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element. Typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents. | [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer) |
| `<aside>` | Represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes. | [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside)   |
| `<article>` | Represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content. | [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article) |

## Use Body Scroll

Prioritize the `<body>` element as the scrollable page element over child elements. Otherwise you risk the following pitfalls:

1. Mobile browser's "pull to refresh" feature will not work as expected.
2. The Mobile Safari bottom bar will not auto-hide when scrolling vertically.
3. CSS print styles may not work as expected.
4. This can directly interfer with accessbility, especialy on touch screen devices.
5. May introduce inconsistent behavior between each web framework's solution for layouts.

## Tailwind Utilities

Tailwind provides the following utility classes, which can be helpful when generating custom layouts.

### Grid

| [Place Items](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/place-items) | Utilities for controlling how items are justified and aligned at the same time. |
| [Place Self](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/place-self) | Utilities for controlling how an individual item is justified and aligned at the same time. |

### Responsive Design

We recommend you opt for Tailwind's built-in [responsive breakpoints](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design) for handling responsive design.

```html
<!-- Use a single column on small screens; show multiple columns at the medium breakpoit or wider -->
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-[auto_1fr]">
	<!-- Hide the sidebar on small screens; show at the medium breakpoint or wider -->
	<aside class="hidden md:block">(sidebar)</aside>
	<!-- Remains visible at all breakpoints -->
	<main>(main)</main>
</div>
```

By default, your `<html>` and `<body>` may collapse vertically and not extend to full height of the viewport. Consider a custom reset:

```css
html,
body {
	@apply h-full;
}
```

## The Basics

Let's start by creating a few traditional layouts using a combination of semantic HTML and Tailwind utility classes.

### One Column

<Preview client:load>
	<Fragment slot="preview">
		<ExampleColOne />
	</Fragment>
	<Fragment slot="code">
		{/* <Code code={ExampleColOneRaw} lang="astro" /> */}
		<figure class="card-enhanced-gradient flex justify-center p-8">
			<a
				class="btn preset-filled"
				href="https://play.tailwindcss.com/3ayrvPnIC4"
				target="_blank"
			>
				View on Tailwind Play &rarr;
			</a>
		</figure>
	</Fragment>
</Preview>

### Two Column

<Preview client:load>
	<Fragment slot="preview">
		<ExampleColTwo />
	</Fragment>
	<Fragment slot="code">
		{/* <Code code={ExampleColTwoRaw} lang="astro" /> */}
		<figure class="card-enhanced-gradient flex justify-center p-8">
			<a
				class="btn preset-filled"
				href="https://play.tailwindcss.com/yCv0ZOICSx"
				target="_blank"
			>
				View on Tailwind Play &rarr;
			</a>
		</figure>
	</Fragment>
</Preview>

### Three Column

<Preview client:load>
	<Fragment slot="preview">
		<ExampleColThree />
	</Fragment>
	<Fragment slot="code">
		{/* <Code code={ExampleColThreeRaw} lang="astro" /> */}
		<figure class="card-enhanced-gradient flex justify-center p-8">
			<a
				class="btn preset-filled"
				href="https://play.tailwindcss.com/BH0iosKxix"
				target="_blank"
			>
				View on Tailwind Play &rarr;
			</a>
		</figure>
	</Fragment>
</Preview>


## Sticky Positioning

If you wish for your header or sidebar to remain fixed while scrolling, use the following techniques.

### Sticky Header

For `<header>`, we'll implement on three utlity classes:

- [sticky](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/position#sticky-positioning-elements) - Sets the CSS display to a value of sticky.
- [top-0](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/top-right-bottom-left) - Sets the top offset to a value of 0px.
- [z-10](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/z-index) - Sets the z-index stacking to a value of 10.

> TIP: Use [backdrop-blur](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/backdrop-blur) to produce the hazy glass-like effect for overlapped semi-transparent elements.

<Preview client:load>
	<Fragment slot="preview">
		<ExampleStickyHeader />
	</Fragment>
	<Fragment slot="code">
		{/* <Code code={ExampleStickyHeaderRaw} lang="astro" /> */}
		<figure class="card-enhanced-gradient flex justify-center p-8">
			<a
				class="btn preset-filled"
				href="https://play.tailwindcss.com/g7ory5pA4K"
				target="_blank"
			>
				View on Tailwind Play &rarr;
			</a>
		</figure>
	</Fragment>
</Preview>

### Sticky Sidebar

For `<aside>`, we introduce two addition utility classes:

- [col-span-1](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/grid-column) - by defining our columns in an explicitly, we ensure all styles display as expected.
- [h-screen](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/height#viewport-height) - ensures our sidebar matches the height of the viewport.

> NOTE: due to the use of `h-screen` we've skipped the embedded preview to provide more accurate results.

<figure class="card-enhanced-gradient flex justify-center p-8">
	<a
		class="btn preset-filled"
		href="https://play.tailwindcss.com/aSzgim96nc"
		target="_blank"
	>
		View on Tailwind Play &rarr;
	</a>
</figure>

## Advanced Techniques

### Calculate Offsets

You may use [calc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc) to calculate offsets, which can be handy when you have multiple sticky elements.

```html
<aside class="... sticky top-0 h-[calc(100vh-100px)]">(sidebar)</aside>
```

1. Sets the `height` value using an abitrary syntax
2. The initial value is set to 100vh (100% of the viewport height)
3. Finally we subtrack the offset for our header (ex: 100px)

### Smart Grid Rows

Combine the grid arbitrary syntax with [minmax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/minmax) to dynamically set a min and max range for your columns or rows. This is useful when creating a three column layout that need to adhere to a max container width.

```html
<div class="container mx-auto grid grid-cols-[200px_minmax(0px,_1fr)_300px]">
	<aside>(sidebar)</aside>
	<main>(main)</main>
	<aside>(sidebar)</aside>
</div>
```

### Grid Template

If you wish to go beyond Tailwind, native CSS also offers [grid-template](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template). This provides a declarative shorthand for defining grid columns, grid rows, and grid areas. Just make sure to match your [Tailwind configuration](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design) when it comes to [media query breakpoints](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries).
