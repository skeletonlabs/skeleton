## How to Contribute

Take care to read all contributions guidelines before you begin!

1. Learn how to [contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).
2. Follow a [step-by-step guide](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) to practice your first contribution.
3. Locate an [open issue on GitHub](https://github.com/skeletonlabs/skeleton/issues). Post a comment letting us know you wish to volunteer.
4. Optionally, you may coordinate efforts on the `#contributors` channel within [Discord](https://discord.gg/EXqV7W8MtY).
5. A member of the Skeleton team will assign the issue to you and help outline requirements.
6. Complete the work and submit a pull request per the requirements on this page.

> NOTE: non-trivial PRs submitted without our prior consent will be denied. Repeat offenders will be blocked.

## Using PNPM

Skeleton makes use of [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) and [PNPM workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) to maintain all projects within the Skeleton monorepo.

1. [Install PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation) on your local computer.
2. [Fork the Skeleton monorepo](https://github.com/skeletonlabs/skeleton) via the option on GitHub.
3. Use Git to clone the forked project to your local machine.
4. Run `pnpm i` from the root to install the required dependencies.
5. Point your terminal at one of the `/sites` or `/package` projects detailed below.
6. Run `pnpm dev` to start a local dev server for each project.

> NOTE: Make sure you're running `pnpm 9.5.0` or higher. You can check with `pnpm --version`.

### Adding Dependencies

As a courtesy, please consult with Skeleton team members before adding dependencies. We may be able to offer alternatives.

Dependencies may be installed using the standard `pnpm i` command. However, in some cases it may be beneficial to maintain a uniform version shared across multiple projects or within each `package.json`. For this we can make use of [PNPM Catalogs](https://pnpm.io/catalogs).

The master version is maintained in the monorepo root in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:

```yaml
catalog:
	# ...
	<package>: <version>
```

Use the following convention to link each project's dependency to the shared Catalog version:

```bash
pnpm add <package>@catalog:
```

## Monorepo Structure

### Sites

Public facing websites that are deployed and hosted for users to browse.

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/sites/skeleton.dev` | The production documentation website. |
| `/sites/themes.skeleton.dev` | The Skeleton themes generator website |

### Packages

Modular Skeleton packages distributed via NPM.

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/packages/skeleton` | The Skeleton core package, containing the Tailwind plugin. |
| `/packages/skeleton-react` | The Skeleton React package, containing Skeleton React components. |
| `/packages/skeleton-svelte` | The Skeleton Svelte package, containing Skeleton Svelte components. |
| `/packages/cli` | The public-facing Skeleton CLI. Used for migrations, etc. |
| `/packages/necroparser` | An internal tool for generating component type schema for API references. |
| `/packages/vite-plugin-tw-plugin-watcher` | An internal tool handling HRM updates to the Tailwind plugin. |

## Branch

Skeleton utilizes three primary branches.

| Branch   | Description                                        | Pull Requests                                  |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `master` | Represents the release branch of the all projects. | <X size={16} className='inline' /> Never       |
| `dev`    | Represents a queue of new features prepped for release.  | <Check size={16} className='inline' /> Allowed |
| `next`    | Represents the bleeding edge pre-release branch.  | <Check size={16} className='inline' /> Allowed |

### PR Branch Conventions

Please use the following naming convention when creating your pull request.

| Branch      | Role                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `docs/*`    | When updating the documentation site. |
| `feature/*` | When implementing a new feature.      |
| `chore/*`   | When implementing small changes.      |
| `bugfix/*`  | When implementing feature bugfixes.   |

Keep branch names short and semantic, and use snake-case to separate words.

```
docs/get-started-typo-fix
bugfix/accordion-render-issue
```

## Changesets

[Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) are used to automatically generate the changelog for each release. Any contributions made within `/packages` must contain a Changeset, while contributions within `/sites` should never include a Changeset.

Follow these instructions to generate a changeset:

1. Make sure you're within your local pull request feature branch.
2. Navigate to the root of the Skeleton monorepo.
3. Run `pnpm changeset` to trigger the Changeset CLI.
4. Follow the instructions when prompted.
5. Changeset are added as `.md` files within the `/.changeset` directory.
6. You may edit or revise a Changeset before your PR is merged.

Changesets use semantic versioning. We recommend the following convention.

| Version | Role                                         |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `major` | Do not use. Reserved for maintainers only.   |
| `minor` | For notable changes, such as a new feature.  |
| `patch` | For small changes, such as a fixing a typo.  |

Changeset descriptions will appear verbatim on the [Changelog](https://github.com/skeletonlabs/skeleton/blob/dev/packages/skeleton/CHANGELOG.md). Keep it short, semantic, and and include the same [branch prefix](/docs/resources/contribute/get-started#pr-branch-conventions).

```mdx
---
'@skeletonlabs/skeleton-svelte': minor
---

feature: Added a new `background` component prop.
```

## Tooling

Skeleton makes use of the following technology to improve the developer experience. It's recommended you run these tools before flagging the PR as "ready for review".

### Root Commands

Run the following commands in the monorepo root to recursively check each PNPM workspace project:

- `pnpm check` - triggers each project's respective diagnostic tooling, such a [Svelte Check](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools).
- `pnpm format` - triggers [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to automatically format code to the defined rulesets.
- `pnpm lint` - triggers [ES Lint](https://eslint.org/) to check for any pending linting issues.
- `pnpm test` - runs all available unit test using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).

### Local Commands

Additionally, you may also run the local instance of each command. Consult the local `package.json` for available options. For `format` and `lint` commands, use the following syntax to draw from the global configuration, but isolate to the current PNPM workspace:

```console
pnpm -w format
pnpm -w lint
```
