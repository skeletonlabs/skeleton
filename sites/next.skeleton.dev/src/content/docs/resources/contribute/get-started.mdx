## How to Contribute

Take care to read all contributions guidelines before you begin!

1. Learn how to [contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).
2. Follow a [step-by-step guide](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) to practice your first contribution.
3. Locate an [open issue on GitHub](https://github.com/skeletonlabs/skeleton/issues). Let us know you would like to volunteer.
4. Optionally, you may coordinate efforts on the `#contributors` channel within [Discord](https://discord.gg/EXqV7W8MtY).
5. If the Skeleton team approves your request, you'll be assigned to the issue.
6. Complete the work and submit a pull request and we'll review the changes.

> NOTE: non-trivial PRs submitted without our prior consent will be denied. Repeat offenders will be banned.

## Using PNPM

Skeleton makes use of [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) and [PNPM workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) to maintain all projects within the Skeleton monorepo.

1. [Install PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation) on your local computer.
2. [Fork the Skeleton monorepo](https://github.com/skeletonlabs/skeleton) via the option on GitHub.
3. Use Git to clone the forked project to your local machine.
4. Point your terminal at one of the sites or package projects listed below.
5. Run `pnpm i` to install the required depedencies.
6. Run `pnpm dev` to start a local dev server for each project.

> NOTE: Make sure you're running `pnpm 9.5.0` or higher. You can check with `pnpm --version`.

### Adding Dependencies

Dependencies may be installed using the standard `pnpm i` command. However, in some cases it may be beneficial to maintain a uniform version shared across multiple projects or within each `package.json`. For this we can make use of [PNPM Catalogs](https://pnpm.io/catalogs).

The master version is maintained in the monorepo root in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:

```yaml
catalog:
 # ...
 <package>: <version>
```

Use the following convention to link each project's dependency to the shared Catalog version:

```bash
pnpm add <package>@catalog:
```

## Monorepo Structure

### Sites

Public facing websites that are deployed to Vercel.

| Path                         | Description                                        |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `/sites/skeleton.dev`        | The production skeleton.dev documentation website. |
| `/sites/next.skeleton.dev`   | The temporary Next/v3 documentation website.       |
| `/sites/themes.skeleton.dev` | The Skeleton themes generator website              |

### Packages

Modular Skeleton packages distributed via NPM.

| Path                            | Description                                                         |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/packages/skeleton`            | The Skeleton core package, containing the Tailwind plugin.          |
| `/packages/skeleton-react`      | The Skeleton React package, containing Skeleton React components.   |
| `/packages/skeleton-svelte`     | The Skeleton Svelte package, containing Skeleton Svelte components. |
| `/packages/create-skeleton-app` | The Skeleton onboarding CLI application.                            |

## Branch

Skeleton uses two primary branches. All pull requests should be created from and to the `dev` branch.

| Branch   | Description                                        | Pull Requests                                  |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `dev`    | Represents the bleeding edge developement branch.  | <Check size={16} className='inline' /> Allowed |
| `master` | Represents the release branch of the all projects. | <X size={16} className='inline' /> Never       |

### PR Branch Conventions

Please use the following naming convention when creating your pull request.

| Branch      | Role                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `docs/*`    | When updating the documentation site. |
| `feature/*` | When implementing a new feature.      |
| `chore/*`   | When implementing small changes.      |
| `bugfix/*`  | When implementing feature bugfixes.   |

Keep branch names short and semantic, using dashes to seperate words.

```
docs/get-started-typo-fix
bugfix/accordion-render-issue
```

## Changesets

[Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) are used to automatically generate the changelog for each release. Any contributions made within `/packages` must contain a Changeset, contributions within `/sites` should not include a Changeset.

Use the following instructions to generate a changeset.

1. Make sure you're within your local pull request feature branch.
2. Navigate to the root of the Skeleton monorepo.
3. Run `pnpm changeset` to trigger the Changeset CLI.
4. Follow the instructions when prompted.
5. Changeset are added as `.md` files within the `/.changeset` directory.
6. You may edit or revise a Changeset right up until release.

Changesets use semantic version. We recommend the following convention.

| Version | Role                                         |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `major` | Do not use. Reserved for maintainers.        |
| `minor` | For notable changes, such as a new features. |
| `patch` | For small changes, such as a fixing a typo.  |

Changeset descriptions will appear verbatim on the [Changelog](https://github.com/skeletonlabs/skeleton/blob/dev/packages/skeleton/CHANGELOG.md). Keep it short, semantic, and prefix this like branch names.

```mdx
---
'@skeletonlabs/skeleton-svelte': minor
---

feature: Added a new `background` component prop.
```

## Tooling

Skeleton makes use of the following technology to improve the developer experience. It's recommended you run these tools regularly while working on new contributions, ideally before each commit.

### Root Commands

Run the following commands in the monorepo root to recursively check each PNPM workspace project:

- `pnpm check` - triggers each project's respective diagnostic tooling, such a [Svelte Check](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools).
- `pnpm format` - triggers [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to automatically format code to the defined rulesets.
- `pnpm lint` - triggers [ES Lint](https://eslint.org/) to check for any pending linting issues.
- `pnpm test` - triggers all available test cases using tools such as [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).

### Local Commands

Additionally, you may also run the local instance of each command. Consult the local `package.json` for available options. For `format` and `lint` commands, use the following syntax to draw from the global configuration, but isolate to the current PNPM workspace:

```console
pnpm -w format
pnpm -w lint
```
