## Requirements

The core of Skeleton is our [Tailwind Plugin](/docs/get-started/plugin), which provides access to our framework agnostic [design system](/docs/get-started/fundamentals#design-system) and [Tailwind-based](/docs/get-started/fundamentals#tailwind) features - everything _except_ components. This comes with two prerequisites:

| Tooling                              | Minimum Version       |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Package Management                   | NPM, PNPM, Yarn, etc. |
| [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) | 3                     |

The exact instructions for installing Skeleton will differ per framework, however we've provided a generic guide below. Use this as a foundation for getting started in non-supported frameworks.

<Process>
    <ProcessStep step="1">
        ### Create a Project
        Scaffold your web-based application using any framework (such as [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/), [SolidStart](https://start.solidjs.com/), [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), etc.)
    </ProcessStep>
    <ProcessStep step="2">
        ### Install Tailwind
		Follow the [official instructions](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides) to install Tailwind for your framework of choice.
    </ProcessStep>
    <ProcessStep step="3">
        ### Install Skeleton
        Install the Skeleton core package to gain access to the Skeleton Tailwind plugin.
        ```console
        npm i -D @skeletonlabs/skeleton@next
        ```
    </ProcessStep>
    <ProcessStep step="4">
        ### Configure Tailwind
        Open `tailwind.config` in the root of your project. The structure of this file may differ slightly for your framework.
        ```ts title="tailwind.config" {1,2, 13-16}
		import { skeleton } from '@skeletonlabs/skeleton/plugin';
		import * as themes from '@skeletonlabs/skeleton/themes';

        /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
    	export default {
    		content: [
    			// IMPORTANT: preserve any settings provided here
    		],
    		theme: {
    			extend: {},
    		},
    		plugins: [
    			skeleton({
    				// NOTE: each theme included will increase the size of your CSS bundle
    				themes: [themes.cerberus, themes.rose],
    			}),
    		],
    	};
        ```
    </ProcessStep>
    <ProcessStep step="6">
        ### Set Active Theme
        Open the file containing the `<body>` tag for your project and set the `data-theme` attribute to define your active theme.
        ```html
        <body data-theme="cerberus">...</body>
        ```
    </ProcessStep>
    <ProcessStep step="check">
        ### Run the Project
        Start the dev server for your framework of choice.
    </ProcessStep>

</Process>

## Support

While we officially limit support for Skeleton to React, Svelte, and Astro for now, Skeleton has an active community of users on [GitHub](https://github.com/skeletonlabs/skeleton/discussions) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/EXqV7W8MtY). If you need support (directly related to Skeleton) considering reaching out in these spaces. Other members of the community may be able to assist you.
