<p class="type-scale-5">Skeleton takes an agnostic approach to icons, meaning you can use any combination of SVGs, emoji, unicode, or dedicated icon
	libraries. Mix and match to fulfill your project's unique requirements.</p>

## Lucide

<figure class="linker">
	<div class="flex gap-4">
		<Heart size={48} />
		<UserRound size={48} />
		<Triangle size={48} />
	</div>
</figure>

If you're looking for an opinionated solution, Skeleton recommends [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/). This provides a huge selection of icons that are available to all popular frameworks and feature a clean and modern style. All code examples in this documentation site implement Lucide, but feel free to replace with any alternative.

### Installation

Follow the official instructions to install [Lucide for Svelte](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-svelte).

## Usage

For optimal performance we recommend importing each icon using the full path.

```svelte
<script>
	import IconSkull from 'lucide-svelte/icons/skull';
</script>

<IconSkull color="#ff3e98" />
```
