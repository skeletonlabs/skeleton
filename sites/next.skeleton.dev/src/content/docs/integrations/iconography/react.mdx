import { Triangle, Heart, UserRound } from 'lucide-react';

export const components = componentSet;

<p class="type-scale-5">Skeleton takes an agnostic approach to icons, meaning you can use any combination of SVGs, emoji, unicode, or dedicated icon
	libraries. Mix and match to fulfill your project's unique requirements.</p>

## Lucide

<figure class="linker">
	<div class="flex gap-4">
		<Heart size={48} />
		<UserRound size={48} />
		<Triangle size={48} />
	</div>
</figure>
