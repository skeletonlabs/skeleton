<p class="type-scale-5">Skeleton makes use of Tailwind's [Dark Mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) out of the box. This allows the mode to be toggle manually by end users, automatically via operating system settings, or through a combination of both.</p>

## Fundamentals

Tailwind offers two strategies, enabled within your project's [Tailwind configuration](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode).

### Selector Strategy

```ts
darkMode: 'selector'
```

See [Tailwind's recommendations](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode#toggling-dark-mode-manually) for toggling the selector. This is accomplished by adding or removing  a `.dark` class to your document's `<html>` element to determine the mode.

### Media Strategy

```ts
darkMode: 'media'
```

Uses CSS's [prefers-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) to set the mode based on operating system settings. In some browser and devices this may require you to refresh the browser page to reflect the changes.

## Styling Elements

When styling elements with Tailwind, the base color represents light mode, while the `dark:` modifier overrides this value for dark mode. Note that all Skeleton components implement this technique to handle either the display for either mode.

```html
<!--
Light Mode: White Background
Dark Mode: Black Background
-->
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-black">...</div>
```

## Using Color Parings

Skeleton provides utility classes called [Color Pairings](/docs/design/colors#color-pairings). These combine both base and dark mode classes into a singular class, enabling an opinionated way to balance Skeleton theme colors for either mode.

## Lightswitch Alternatives

In legacy versions of Skeleton we offered a `<Lightswitch>` component for toggling dark mode using the `selector` strategy. Unfortunately this is no longer possible given the sheer number of combinations of use cases:

- Supporting the `selector`, `media`, or a hybrid strategy.
- Supporting the unique APIs of each tech stacks and/or meta-framework.
- Handling state and persistence; local vs remote storage (e.g. account-based storage)

Given this, we recommend the following alternatives:

1. Forego user-based selection in favor of only the `media` strategy, to adhere to the user's OS settings.
2. Generate your own component based on our barebones [Astro component](https://github.com/skeletonlabs/skeleton/blob/next/sites/next.skeleton.dev/src/components/docs/Lightswitch.astro).
3. Use [Tailwind's recommendations](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode#supporting-system-preference-and-manual-selection) and APIs provided to generate a component that meets all your needs.

In the future we hope to revisit this with more specific examples and references.
