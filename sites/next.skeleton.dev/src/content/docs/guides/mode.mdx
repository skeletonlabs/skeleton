<p class="text-xl">Skeleton makes use of Tailwind's [Dark Mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) to enable multiple strategies for defining the mode, as well as [Color Scheme](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/color-scheme) to selectively toggle light or dark interfaces at any scope.</p>

## Dark Mode

Tailwind [multiple strategies](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) for configuring Dark Mode.

### Media Strategy

Enable by default. Uses CSS's [prefers-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) to set the mode based on operating system settings.

### Selector Strategy

Actives dark mode by adding or removing the`.dark` class on your application's `<html>` element.

```css
@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *));
```

```html
<html class="dark">
	...
</html>
```

### Data Attribute Strategy

Uses a data attribute instead of a class to activate dark mode.

```css
@custom-variant dark (&:where([data-theme=dark], [data-theme=dark] *));
```

```html
<html data-theme="dark">
	...
</html>
```

### Using the Dark Variant

Apply a base style, then with Tailwind's `dark:` variant.

```html
<!-- Light Mode: White | Dark Mode: Black -->
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-black">...</div>
```

## Color Scheme

Skeleton now supports Tailwind's [Color Scheme](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/color-scheme) feature, which enables toggling light or dark interfaces at any scope. By default, scheme adjusts to match your Dark Mode settings above. This enabled by using [Color Pairings](/docs/design/colors#color-pairings), which implement the native CSS property [light-dark](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/light-dark).

```html
<div class="bg-primary-50-950">Light or Dark</div>

<div class="scheme-light">
	<div class="bg-primary-50-950">Always Light Scheme</div>
</div>

<div class="scheme-dark">
	<div class="bg-primary-50-950">Always Dark Scheme</div>
</div>
```

## Lightswitch

Legacy versions of Skeleton offer a unique `<Lightswitch>` component for controlling the Dark Mode `selector` strategy. Unfortunately this is no longer available due to the number of permutations per framework and project requirements:

- Supporting the all or a combination of Dark Mode strategies.
- Supporting the unique APIs of each meta-framework.
- Handling state and persistence; ex: local vs remote vs account-based storage

Please generate your own component based on the capabilities of your framework of choice.
