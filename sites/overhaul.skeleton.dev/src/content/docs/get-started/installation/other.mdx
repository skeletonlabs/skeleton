## Requirements

Skeleton's [Core Package](/docs/get-started/core-api) is framework agnostic, meaning many of the Design System and Tailwind-centric features can used on any number of frameworks. This includes everything _except_ components. In order to install Skeleton for additional framework, your app must be able to support the following:

| Tooling                              | Minimum Supported     |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Package Management                   | NPM, PNPM, Yarn, etc. |
| [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) | 4                     |

The exact instructions for installing Skeleton will differ per framework, however we've provided a general guidance below. Use this as a foundation for getting started in any number of unofficially supported frameworks.

## Installation

<Process>
    <ProcessStep step="1">
        ### Create a Project
        Scaffold your web-based application using any framework (such as [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/), [SolidStart](https://start.solidjs.com/), [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), etc.)
    </ProcessStep>
    <ProcessStep step="2">
        ### Install Tailwind
		Refer to the [official instructions](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides) for installing Tailwind on your framework of choice.
    </ProcessStep>
    <ProcessStep step="3">
        ### Install Skeleton
        Install the Skeleton core package to gain access to most features - excluding Components.
        ```bash
        npm i -D @skeletonlabs/skeleton
        ```
    </ProcessStep>
    <ProcessStep step="4">
        ### Configure Tailwind
        Locate your global stylesheet and append the following at the top of the file.
        ```css {3-5}
        @import 'tailwindcss';

        @import '@skeletonlabs/skeleton';
        @import '@skeletonlabs/skeleton/themes/cerberus';
        ```
    </ProcessStep>
    <ProcessStep step="6">
        ### Set Active Theme
        Open the file containing the `<html>` tag for your project and set the `data-theme` attribute as follows.
        ```html "data-theme="cerberus""
        <html data-theme="cerberus">
            ...
        </html>
        ```
    </ProcessStep>
    <ProcessStep step="check">
        ### Run the Project
        Start the dev server for your framework of choice.
    </ProcessStep>

</Process>
