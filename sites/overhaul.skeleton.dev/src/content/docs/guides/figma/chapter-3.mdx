	Skeleton is continually evolving, and to ensure that your design remains in harmony with it, it's essential to keep the Skeleton Figma UI
	library up to date.
</p>

## How to update the library

<Process>
    <ProcessStep step="1">
        ### Download the latest version of the Skeleton Figma UI library

        <a href='https://polar.sh/skeleton-kit/' className='btn preset-filled'>Download</a>
    </ProcessStep>

    <ProcessStep step="2">
        ### Import the new version to your Figma library

        From the project page, click `Create new`² in the top-right corner and select `Import`³. Then, choose `Import from computer`⁴ and select the Skeleton Figma file.

    </ProcessStep>

    <ProcessStep step="3">
        ### Publish new version

        Double-click the new version of Skeleton v3 Figma UI Library to open it.

        <p className="relative">At the top left, next to the library file name, click the  <span class="badge-icon preset-filled"><ChevronDown size={16}/></span> ⁵ icon and select `Publish library…` ⁶. In the modal, click `Publish` ⁷ and wait for the library to finish publishing.</p>

    </ProcessStep>

    <ProcessStep step="4">
        ### Swap libraries

        Open the project that uses the old version of Skeleton v3 Figma UI library. Open the `Assets`⁸ tab and click on the <span class="badge-icon preset-filled"><BookOpen size={16} /></span> ⁹ icon to open the `Manage libraries`¹⁰ popup.

        In the `Libraries added to this file` section, select the old version of the Skeleton v3 Figma UI library¹¹.

         <p className='pt-4'>In the top right corner of the popup, click `Choose library`¹³, select the latest Skeleton v3 Figma UI library¹⁴, and then click `Swap library`¹⁵.</p>

    </ProcessStep>

</Process>

### Remove previous version

After updating the Skeleton Figma library, please remove previous versions. Keeping multiple versions can create multiple copies of the same components, leading to design inconsistencies.

Open the project that utilizes the old version of Skeleton v3 Figma UI library. Open `Assets`¹ tab and click on <span class="badge-icon preset-filled"><BookOpen size={16} /></span> ² icon to open `Manage libraries` popup.

In the `Libraries added to this file` section, click the `Remove`³ button next to the old version of the Skeleton v3 Figma UI library.
