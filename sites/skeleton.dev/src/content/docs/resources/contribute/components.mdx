### Dev Server

To run all packages/playgrounds/sites in watch mode, use the following command in the monorepo root:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

### Server Ports

The following represents the _default_ localhost address and port for each project. This will be displayed in the terminal when starting each dev server.

- Documentation Site: `http://localhost:4321/`
- SvelteKit Playground: `http://localhost:5173/`
- NextJS Playground: `http://localhost:3000/`

You may run the documentation site and framework packages in parallel at the same time. If the server shares a port, this will increment by one for the next server (ex: `5174`, `5175`, etc). Keep your eye on the terminal to retrieve the specific local address.

## Add Components

Components are housed in the following location per framework:

| Framework | Directory         |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| Svelte    | `/src/components` |
| React     | `/src/components` |

Use the following path and filename conventions when creating a new component:

```
/components
    /<component>
        <component>.{svelte|tsx|...}
        <component>.test.ts
		index.ts
        types.ts
```

---

## Zag.js

Skeleton components are built atop a foundation of [Zag.js](https://zagjs.com/). This provides a suite of headless component primitives that handle logic and state, while providing a universal set of features. The Skeleton design system is then implemented as a layer on top of this.

When introducing a new Skeleton component, please refer to the documentation for each respective framework. For example:

- Avatar (React): https://zagjs.com/components/react/avatar
- Avatar (Svelte): https://zagjs.com/components/svelte/avatar

In most cases you can follow the documentation instructions verbatim to generate the foundation for the new component. Please refer to other components for specific implementation details. Continue reading below to learn how to further augment the component with all Skeleton-specific conventions.

---

## Props

Skeleton designates a few categories of component properties. These should be maintained in the following order.

```ts
let {
	// Functional
	open = false,
	// Style
	base ='...',
	bg = '...',
	classes = '...',
	// Event
	onclick = () => {},
	// Snippets
	lead
	trail
	children,
	// Zag (when applicable)
	...zagProps
}: Props = $props();
```

- **Functional** - these should be single instance props that directly affect the functionality of the component.
- **Style** - contain and accept Tailwind utility classes to affect the style of the component.
- **Event** - provide callback functions for external event handlers.
- **Children** - contain reference to React children, Svelte Snippets, or similar.
- **Zag** - when applicable, these rest props that are spread directly into the Zag machine.

### Style Prop Conventions

Style props implement semantic naming conventions to enable specificity and avoid naming conflicts. These are organized into three specific categories. Each should be maintained in the following order.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	let {
		// Parent
		base = '...',
		bg = '...',
		classes = '...',
		// Control
		controlBase = '...',
		controlBg = '...',
		controlClasses = '...',
		// Panel
		panelBase = '...',
		panelBg = '...',
		panelPadding = '...',
		panelClasses = '...'
	}: Props = $props();
</script>

<!-- Parent -->
<div class="{base} {bg} {classes}">
	<!-- Control -->
	<div class="{controlBase} {controlBg} {controlClasses}">...</div>
	<!-- Panel -->
	<div class="{panelBase} {panelBg} {panelPadding} {panelClasses}">...</div>
</div>
```

- `base` - houses any structural utility classes, which can be replaced in a faux-headless manner.
  - The outermost element is referred to as the Parent in this context. Elements within are children.
  - Parent props are not prefixed, which helps maintain parity cross-framework
  - Child props are prefixed: `titleBase`, `panelBase`, `controlBase`.
- `{property}` - individual style props that house one or more “swappable” utility classes.
  - Naming should follow Tailwind convention, except for single letter descriptors (ex: `padding` instead of `p`).
  - Parent props are not prefixed: `background`, `margin`, `border`.
  - Child props are prefixed: `titleBg`, `controlMargin`, `panelBorder`.
- `classes` - allows you to extend or override the class list with an arbitrary set of utility classes.
  - Uses `classes` (plural) to avoid conflict with the standard `class` attribute.
  - Parent instances are not prefixed: `classes`
  - Child instances are prefixed: `titleClasses`, `controlClasses`, `panelClasses`

### Dynamic Style Props

You may need to conditionally update or swap between one or more sets of style prop classes. For this, we will use an derivative pattern as demonstrated below.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	let {
		active = true,
		// ...
		fooActive = '...',
		fooInactive = '...'
		// ...
	}: Props = $props();

	// Derivative
	const activeClasses = $derived(active ? fooActive : fooInactive);
</script>

<div class="{base} {activeClasses} {classes}">...</div>
```

> TIP: Use this convention in React as well, but does not require explicit derival. React automatically re-renders when stateful props change.

---

## Type Definitions

All component props should be strongly typed using Typescript. Each prop should be described using [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/about-getting-started) comments. This provides additional context through Intellisense features of text editors and IDEs and helps generate the schema used for API references on each documentation page.

```ts title="types.ts"
export interface <component>Props {
	/** Sets the open state of the item. */
	open?: boolean;

	// Parent ---
	/** Set the parent base styles. */
	base?: string;
	/** Set the parent background styles. */
	background?: string;
	/** Provide the parent a set of arbitrary classes. */
	classes?: string;

	// Lead ---
	/** Sets the lead snippet element's base styles. */
	leadBase?: string;
	/** Sets the lead snippet element's padding styles. */
	leadPadding?: string;
	/** Provide arbitrary CSS classes to the lead snippet. */
	leadClasses?: string;

	// Children ---
	/** The default slot contents within the component. */
	children?: Snippet;
}
```

- The type file should be co-located with the component and named `types.ts`.
- The interface name should match `<component>Props`.
- Use comments to denote blocks of related props.
- Keep each prop description short and semantic.
- The order should match prop implementation.

## Context API

### Svelte

Skeleton expands the [Svelte Context API](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte#setcontext) via a utility called `createContext`. This adds the following functionality.

- Generates a unique key using the [Symbol API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol).
- Ensures type safety when getting and setting context.
- Allows for a fallback when there is no context provided.

Here's an example of how this can be used:

```ts
import { createContext } from '$lib/internal/create-context.js';

interface Session {
	user: 'foo' | 'bar';
}

export const [setSession, getSession] = createContext<Session>({ user: 'foo' });
```

This can then be consumed as follows:

```ts
import { setSession, getSession } from './context.js';

// Must be set as type of Session:
setSession({ user: 'bar' });

// Returns as type of Session:
const session = getSession();
```

## Form Components

When implementing form components (ex: Segment Control), please adhere to the following conventions:

- For components with a parent/child structure, pass all shared values through the parent.
- Data in should use a `value` prop, while data out should use an `onValueChange` event handler.
- When supported by the framework, use of two-way binding for the `value` is encouraged.
- Pass state that's unique to the child components directly to each child item.
- When embedding form inputs within components for state management, always use `type="hidden"`.

See the examples per each framework below.

### Svelte

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	let value = $state('chocolate');
</script>

<Segment {value} onValueChange={(e) => (value = e.value)} name="flavors">
	<Segment.Item id="chocolate" value="chocolate">Chocolate</Segment.Item>
	<Segment.Item id="strawberry" value="strawberry">Strawberry</Segment.Item>
</Segment>
```

### React

```tsx
const [value, setValue] = useState('chocolate');

return (
	<Segment value={value} onValueChange={(e) => setValue(e.value)} name="flavors">
		<Segment.Item id="chocolate" value="chocolate">
			Chocolate
		</Segment.Item>
		<Segment.Item id="strawberry" value="strawberry">
			Strawberry
		</Segment.Item>
	</Segment>
);
```

## Component Schema

When you add or change component `types.ts` data, new schema data will be generated to populate the component's API Reference in each component's documentation page. This should generate automatically, but can be triggered using `pnpm schema` in the monorepo root. In most cases you you should only need to implement the follow component in the page to display the generated schema data. The schema path will be discovered automatically, and no import is required.

```mdx
## API Reference

<ApiTable />
```

Generated schemas reside in the documentation project, within the following directory.

```
/src/content/schemas/{framework}/{component}.json
```

## Animations

Skeleton opts for what we feel is the most optimal solution for animations per framework. This means implementation and capabilities may differ slightly for each. Please refer to the [Accordion](/docs/components/accordion/react) component source code as reference.

| Package                     | Solution                                                       |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/packages/skeleton-svelte` | [Svelte Transition](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte-transition) |
| `/packages/skeleton-react`  | [Zag Presence](https://zagjs.com/components/react/presence)    |

---

## Composed Pattern

To keep component syntax consistent cross-framework, we utilize what we refer to as a "composed pattern". Components are composed using a set of smaller components, named slots, or snippets - depending on the framework. Implementation differs per framework.

### React

For React, this is handled via piecemeal components using a dot notation syntax, as described in the section below.

```tsx
<Accordion>
	<Accordion.Item>
		<Accordion.Lead>(lead)</Accordion.Lead>
		<Accordion.Control>(control)</Accordion.Control>
		<Accordion.Panel>(panel)</Accordion.Panel>
	</Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>
```

### Svelte

This is handled by pairing child components with [Svelte snippets](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/snippets).

```svelte
<Accordion>
	<Accordion.Item>
		{#snippet controlLead()}(lead){/snippet}
		{#snippet control()}(control){/snippet}
		{#snippet panel()}(panel){/snippet}
	</Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>
```

## Dot Notation Syntax

The implementation of this will differ per component framework.

### React

To implement this, we use `Object.assign()`

```ts
Object.assign(Root, { Child1, Child2, Child3 });
```

For example, the accordion component would be setup as follows as the bottom of the `Accordion.tsx` file.

```ts
export const Accordion = Object.assign(
	AccordionRoot, // -> <Accordion>
	{
		Item: AccordionItem, // -> <Accordion.Item>
		Control: AccordionControl, // -> <Accordion.Control>
		Panel: AccordionPanel // -> <Accordion.Panel>
	}
);
```

### Svelte

Create a new `index.ts` file colocated within the `/component/<ComponentName>` directory:

```ts
import Accordion from './Accordion.svelte';
import AccordionItem from './AccordionItem.svelte';

export const Accordion = Object.assign(
	Accordion, // -> <Accordion>
	{
		Item: AccordionItem // -> <Accordion.Item>
	}
);
```

## Component Exports

Finally, make sure components are included in the package export list.

### React

Found in `/src/lib/index.ts`.

```ts
export * from '../components/Foo/index.js';
export * from '../components/Bar/index.js';
```

### Svelte

Found in `/src/lib/index.ts`.

```ts
export { default as Foo } from './components/Foo.svelte';
export { default as Bar } from './components/Bar.svelte';
```
