## Using PNPM

Skeleton makes use of [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) and [PNPM workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) to maintain all projects within the Skeleton monorepo.

1. [Install PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation) on your local computer.
2. [Fork the Skeleton monorepo](https://github.com/skeletonlabs/skeleton) via the option on GitHub.
3. Use Git to clone the forked project to your local machine.
4. Run `pnpm i` from the root to install the required dependencies.
5. Point your terminal at one of the `/sites`, `/packages` or `/playgrounds` projects detailed below.
6. Run `pnpm dev` to start a local dev server for each project.

## Monorepo Structure

### PR Branch Conventions

Please use the following naming convention when creating your pull request.

| Branch      | Role                                                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `docs/*`    | When making edits to the docs.                               |
| `feature/*` | When adding a new feature.                                   |
| `task/*`    | When making changes to the build process or auxiliary tools. |
| `bugfix/*`  | When fixing a bug.                                           |

Keep branch names short and semantic, and use kebab-case to separate words:

```
docs/get-started-typo
bugfix/accordion-render-issue
```

## Changesets

[Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) are used to automatically generate the changelog for each release.

- Any contributions made within `/packages` _must_ contain a Changeset
- Any contributions made within `/sites` should **not** include a Changeset.

Follow these instructions to generate a changeset:

1. Navigate to the root of the Skeleton monorepo.
2. Run `pnpm changeset` to trigger the Changeset CLI.
3. Select the packages that are affected by your changes.
4. Select the type of version bump required (major, minor, patch).
5. Provide a short description of the changes made.

Changesets use semantic versioning. We recommend the following convention.

| Version | Role                                                                       |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `major` | For breaking changes, such as changing the API of a component or function. |
| `minor` | For notable changes, such as a new feature.                                |
| `patch` | For small changes, such as a fixing a bug.                                 |

Changeset descriptions will appear verbatim on the corresponding CHANGELOG.md. Keep it short, semantic, and and include the same [branch prefix](/docs/[framework]/resources/contribute/get-started#pr-branch-conventions).

```md
---
'@skeletonlabs/skeleton-svelte': minor

feat: Added `Avatar` component.
```

## Tooling

Skeleton makes use of the following technology to improve the developer experience. It's recommended you run these tools before flagging the PR as "ready for review" on GitHub.
