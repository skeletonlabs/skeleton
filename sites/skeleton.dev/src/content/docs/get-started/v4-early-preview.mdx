## Component

Starting in Skeleton v4, we will introduce a new component API for Skeleton, for all supported frameworks. This comes in the form of three primary changes, which we'll cover below.

### Composed Pattern

The component structure will now be much more explicit and granular. While a bit more verbose, this offers direct access to all children within the component tree. Allowing you to pass pass arbitrary props and attributes directly to the the HTML template within. Including: `required`, `data-*`, `style`, `class`, and many other attributes.

```svelte
<Accordion>
	<Accordion.Item value="item-1">
		<Accordion.Heading>
			<Accordion.Trigger>Item 1</Accordion.Trigger>
			<Accordion.Content>Content for Item 1</Accordion.Content>
		</Accordion.Heading>
	</Accordion.Item>
	<Accordion.Item value="item-2">
		<Accordion.Heading>
			<Accordion.Trigger>Item 2</Accordion.Trigger>
			<Accordion.Content>Content for Item 2</Accordion.Content>
		</Accordion.Heading>
	</Accordion.Item>
	<Accordion.Item value="item-3">
		<Accordion.Heading>
			<Accordion.Trigger>Item 3</Accordion.Trigger>
			<Accordion.Content>Content for Item 3</Accordion.Content>
		</Accordion.Heading>
	</Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>
```

### Simpler Stying

The most painful part of using Skeleton in the past has been learning the unique conventions needed to apply styles to to each component. Previously we relied on reserved prop names, special prefixes, etc. This is no longer the case. You simply provide your styles via a common `class` attribute per component.

**v3 Styling**

```svelte
<Avatar ... rounded="rounded-2xl" imageClasses="grayscale" />
```

**v4 Styling**

```svelte
<Avatar class="rounded-2xl">
	<Avatar.Image src="https://i.pravatar.cc/150?img=48" class="greyscale" />
	<Avatar.Fallback>SK</Avatar.Fallback>
</Avatar>
```

Rather than opting for additional tooling like [Tailwind Merge](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge) under the hood, we instead accomplish this using the new custom variant syntax provided in Tailwind 4. This enables us to assign all internal styles to the `@base` layer in the CSS bundle.

```css
@custom-variant skb {
	@layer base {
		@slot;
	}
}
```

We inject these default Tailwind utility classes to the `class` attribute within each component, but prefix them with `skb` (short for "Skeleton Base"). This allows us us to denote the base classes automatically.

```ts
{
	class: "skb:bg-surface-500 skb:rounded-full"
}
```

Then, when you supply custom classes via the `class` attribute, those are appended to the end of the class list and automatically take precedence. And the composed component structure ensures you always target your desired element in the tree. Leading to a much more intuative experience overall. It should feel much closer to working with native HTML elements.

### Extensible Markup

Finally we're adding one more tool to your toolkit - the ability to override and modify the component template markup.

**React**

```tsx
export default function () {
	return (
		<Accordion>
			<Accordion.Item value="item-1">
				<Accordion.Heading>
					<Accordion.Trigger element={({ attributes }) => <button {...attributes}>My Own Button</button>} />
					<Accordion.Content>Content for Item 1</Accordion.Content>
				</Accordion.Heading>
			</Accordion.Item>
			{/* ... */}
		</Accordion>
	);
}
```

**Svelte**

```svelte
<Accordion>
	<Accordion.Item value="item-1">
		<Accordion.Heading>
			<Accordion.Trigger>
				{#snippet element({ attributes })}
					<button {...attributes}>My Own Button</button>
				{/snippet}
			</Accordion.Trigger>
			<Accordion.Content>Content for Item 1</Accordion.Content>
		</Accordion.Heading>
	</Accordion.Item>
	<!-- ... -->
</Accordion>
```

By exposing the the the internal attributes, this enables you to modify and override the inherent HTML markup as you see fit. Though we'll try to warn you when modifying the semantic element type might introduce accessibility issues.

## Early Access Preview

If you're interested in trying our early preview of the new Skeleton v4 components, you can do so immediately by simply updating to the latest versions of the production v3 Skeleton packages:

- `@skeletonlabs/skeleton` - for styling
- `@skeletonlabs/skeleton-react` - for React components
- `@skeletonlabs/skeleton-svelte` for Svelte components

We have currently provided two new components that follow the above patterns. There are available in parallel to their standard v3 variants, which means you can easily swap between at will.

- Avatars: [React](/docs/components-composed/avatar/react) | [Svelte](/docs/components-composed/avatar/svelte)
- Accordions: [React](/docs/components-composed/accordion/react) | [Svelte](/docs/components-composed/accordion/svelte)

## Request for Comment

For the duration of this preview, we ask that you please test the new structure, styling, and markup features in your real-world projects. Note that these are considered experimental, and are subject to breaking changes at any time. However, we encourage you to share feedback in both [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/EXqV7W8MtY) (via `#contributors`) or leave a comment on [GitHub](https://github.com/skeletonlabs/skeleton). We'll aim to provide regular progress updates as we can.
