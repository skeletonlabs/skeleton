## Component

Starting in Skeleton v4, we will now be introducing a new structure and API for the Skeleton for all supported frameworks. This comes in the form of three primary changes, which we'll cover in detail below.

### Composed Pattern

The component structure will now be much more explicit and granular. While a bit more verbose, this offers direct access to all children within the component tree. As well as allowing you to pass pass arbitrary props and attributes to the the HTML template within, including: `required`, `data-*`, `style`, `class`, and many other attributes.

```svelte
<Accordion>
	<Accordion.Item value="item-1">
		<Accordion.Heading>
			<Accordion.Trigger>Item 1</Accordion.Trigger>
			<Accordion.Content>Content for Item 1</Accordion.Content>
		</Accordion.Heading>
	</Accordion.Item>
	<Accordion.Item value="item-2">
		<Accordion.Heading>
			<Accordion.Trigger>Item 2</Accordion.Trigger>
			<Accordion.Content>Content for Item 2</Accordion.Content>
		</Accordion.Heading>
	</Accordion.Item>
	<Accordion.Item value="item-3">
		<Accordion.Heading>
			<Accordion.Trigger>Item 3</Accordion.Trigger>
			<Accordion.Content>Content for Item 3</Accordion.Content>
		</Accordion.Heading>
	</Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>
```

### Simpler Stying

The most painful part of using Skeleton in the past has been learning the unique conventions needed to apply styles to to each component. Previously we relied on reserved prop names, special prefixes, etc. All this is now gone. You simply provide your styles to the common `class` attribute, similar to native HTML elements.

**v3 Styling**

```svelte
<Avatar ... rounded="rounded-2xl" imageClasses="grayscale" />
```

**v4 Styling**

```svelte
<Avatar class="rounded-2xl">
	<Avatar.Image src="https://i.pravatar.cc/150?img=48" class="greyscale" />
	<Avatar.Fallback>SK</Avatar.Fallback>
</Avatar>
```

Rather than opting for additional tooling like [Tailwind Merge](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge), we accomplish this using the new custom variant syntax provided in Tailwind 4. This enables us to assign all internal styles to the `@base` layer in the CSS bundle.

```css
@custom-variant skb {
	@layer base {
		@slot;
	}
}
```

We implement the default Tailwind utility classes to the `class` attribute within each component, but prefix them with `skb` (short for "Skeleton Base"). This allows us us to denote the base classes automatically.

```ts
{
	class: "skb:bg-surface-500 sbk:rounded-full"
}
```

Then, when you supply your classes via the `class` attribute, those are appended to the end of the class list and automatically take precedence. And the composed component structure ensures you always target your desired element in the tree. Leading to a much more intuative experience overall.

### Extensible Markup

Finally we're adding one more tool to your toolkit - the ability to override and modify the component template markup.

**React**

```tsx
export default function () {
	return (
		<Accordion>
			<Accordion.Item value="item-1">
				<Accordion.Heading>
					<Accordion.Trigger element={({ attributes }) => <button {...attributes}>My Own Button</button>} />
					<Accordion.Content>Content for Item 1</Accordion.Content>
				</Accordion.Heading>
			</Accordion.Item>
			{/* ... */}
		</Accordion>
	);
}
```

**Svelte**

```svelte
<Accordion>
	<Accordion.Item value="item-1">
		<Accordion.Heading>
			<Accordion.Trigger>
				{#snippet element({ attributes })}
					<button {...attributes}>My Own Button</button>
				{/snippet}
			</Accordion.Trigger>
			<Accordion.Content>Content for Item 1</Accordion.Content>
		</Accordion.Heading>
	</Accordion.Item>
	<!-- ... -->
</Accordion>
```

By exposing the the the internal attributes, this enables you to modify and override the inherent HTML markup with custom markup. Use this to add, edit, or modify the markup as desired. The only limit is your imagination.

## Early Access Preview

If you're interested in trying our early preview of the new Skeleton v4 components, you can do so right now by updating to the latest version the current production v3 packages:

- `@skeletonlabs/skeleton` - for all users
- `@skeletonlabs/skeleton-react` - for React components
- `@skeletonlabs/skeleton-svelte` for Svelte components

We have updated two new components that follow the above patterns. There are available in parallel to the standard v3 variants, which means you can easily swap between at will.

- Avatars: [React](/docs/components-composed/avatar/react) | [Svelte](/docs/components-composed/avatar/svelte)
- Accordions: [React](/docs/components-composed/accordion/react) | [Svelte](/docs/components-composed/accordion/svelte)

## Request for Comment

For the duration of this preview, we ask that you please test the new components, styling, and markup features in your real-world projects. Note that these are considered experimental, and are subject to change at any time. However, we encourage you to share feedback in both [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/EXqV7W8MtY) (via the `#contributors` channel), or leave a comment on the [GitHub](https://github.com/skeletonlabs/skeleton) announcement.

> NOTE: we'll need to direct link to the GitHub announcement at launch.
