	<p>The Skeleton v4 Release Candidate is an early access preview not yet intended for production use.</p>
</div>

Skeleton v4 introduces a top-to-bottom overhaul of the component APIs. The goal has been to stabalized the internal and external APIs of our component system and ensure we can continue to introduce new components and new component frameworks over time.

## Prerequisites

We recommend you handle all migration changes on a dedicated feature branch. This ensures you can easily drop or revert changes if something goes wrong.

```console
git checkout -b migration
```

Make sure you've accounted for the following:

- Ensure each Skeleton package (core and framework) are updated to the latest v3.x release.
- Update all critical dependencies to their latest version (optional but recommended)
- Your app has been tested and is in a functional state.

## Migrate to v4 RC

For the Release Candidate, please update each Skeleton package to the early access `@next` version. Note that we will be updating these package frequently leading up to the full release.

**React**

```console
npm remove @skeletonlabs/skeleton @skeletonlabs/skeleton-react
npm i -D @skeletonlabs/skeleton@next @skeletonlabs/skeleton-react@next
```

**Svelte**

```console
npm remove @skeletonlabs/skeleton @skeletonlabs/skeleton-svelte
npm i -D @skeletonlabs/skeleton@next @skeletonlabs/skeleton-svelte@next
```

### Remove Source Import

The `@source` import in your global stylesheet (ex: `app.css`) is no longer required. Please remove this, but keep all other Skeleton-related imports.

```css
@source '../node_modules/@skeletonlabs/skeleton-svelte/dist';
```

---

## Migrating Components

Per the Skeleton v4 RC, we do not yet have an automated migration CLI. For now, you will need to manually migrate each component in your project to the new format. Please consult the code snippets found on each respective component's documentation page for reference.

Here's an example of that process using the Avatar component:

**Was (v3)**

```svelte
<Avatar src="https://i.pravatar.cc/150?img=48" name="skeleton" />
```

**Now (v4 RC)**

```svelte
<Avatar>
	<Avatar.Image src="https://i.pravatar.cc/150?img=48" />
	<Avatar.Fallback>SK</Avatar.Fallback>
</Avatar>
```

1. Consult the documentation for [React](/docs/components/avatar/react) or [Svelte](/docs/components/avatar/svelte).
2. Keep the import as is; no changes are required for this component.
3. The root component `<Avatar>` remains; remove the `src` or `name` props.
4. Implement the new `<Avatar.Image>` child to pass the `src` path.
5. Initials are no longer generated via the `name`; specify any fallback with `<Avatar.Fallback>`

> TIP: Use your code editor of choice and search by the v3 component element, such `<Avat...` for Avatar.

### Rename Components

Please note as part of the update to Skeleton v4, some components have been updated to follow [Zag.js](https://zagjs.com/) conventions.

| Was (v3)         | Now (v4)             | v4 Docs                                             |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `<Modal>`        | `<Dialog>`           | [Link](/docs/components/dialog/svelte)              |
| `<ProgressBar>`  | `<Progress>`         | [Link](/docs/components/progress-linear/svelte)     |
| `<ProgressRing>` | `<Progress>`         | [Link](/docs/components/progress-circular/svelte)   |
| `<Ratings>`      | `<RatingsGroup>`     | [Link](/docs/components/rating-group/svelte)        |
| `<Segment>`      | `<SegmentedControl>` | [Link](/docs/components/rasegmented-control/svelte) |

> NOTE: we also recommend checking each sub-component as you go.
