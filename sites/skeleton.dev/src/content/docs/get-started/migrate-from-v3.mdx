<Alert type="warning">The Skeleton v4 Release Candidate is an early access preview and not yet intended for production use.</Alert>

Skeleton v4 introduces a top-to-bottom overhaul of the component APIs. The goal has been to stabalized the internal and external APIs of our component system and ensure we can continue to introduce new components and new component frameworks over time.

## Prerequisites

We recommend you handle all migration changes on a dedicated feature branch. This ensures you can easily drop and revert if anything goes wrong.

```console
git checkout -b migration
```

Make sure you've accounted for the following:

- Ensure both Skeleton packages (core and framework) are updated to the latest v3.x release.
- Update all critical dependencies in your app to their latest version (optional but recommended)
- Your app has been tested and is in a functional state.

---

## Automated Migration

To begin, we will run a quick automated migration.

```console
npx skeleton@next migrate skeleton-4
```

This will handle the following package and stylesheet updates. Once complete, skip to the [Manual Migration](/docs/get-started/migrate-from-v3#manual-migration) steps below, <u>which are required for all migrations</u>.

### Update NPM Packages

For the Release Candidate, please update each Skeleton package to the early access `@next` version. Note that we will be updating these package frequently leading up to the full release.

**React**

```console
npm remove @skeletonlabs/skeleton @skeletonlabs/skeleton-react
npm i -D @skeletonlabs/skeleton@next @skeletonlabs/skeleton-react@next
```

**Svelte**

```console
npm remove @skeletonlabs/skeleton @skeletonlabs/skeleton-svelte
npm i -D @skeletonlabs/skeleton@next @skeletonlabs/skeleton-svelte@next
```

### Update Stylesheet Imports

The following migration steps apply to your global stylesheet (ex: `app.css`).

The `@source` rules for sourcing component styles have been replaced with simpler and more intuitive `@import` rules.

```diff
- @source '../node_modules/@skeletonlabs/skeleton-{framework}/dist';
+ @import '@skeletonlabs/skeleton-{framework}';
```

In Skeleton v3 the [Preset styles](/docs/design/presets) were split to an optional stylesheet to keep them opt-in. However, due to popular demand, these have now been rolled back into the core package. If this import is present, please remove it:

```diff
- @import '@skeletonlabs/skeleton/optional/presets';
```

## Manual Migration

Assuming all above steps have been complete, you will now be required to handle the manual portion of the migration. The steps below are not optional and must be completed to migrate to Skeleton v4.

### Migrating Components

To begin migrating components, please consult the code snippets found on each respective component's documentation page for reference. Below an example of that process specifically for the Avatar component.

**Was (v3)**

```svelte
<Avatar src="https://i.pravatar.cc/150?img=48" name="skeleton" />
```

**Now (v4 RC)**

```svelte
<Avatar>
	<Avatar.Image src="https://i.pravatar.cc/150?img=48" />
	<Avatar.Fallback>SK</Avatar.Fallback>
</Avatar>
```

1. Consult the Avatar documentation for [React](/docs/components/avatar/react) or [Svelte](/docs/components/avatar/svelte).
2. Keep the import as is; no changes are required for this component.
3. The root component `<Avatar>` remains; remove the `src` or `name` props.
4. Implement the new `<Avatar.Image>` child and pass the `src` path.
5. Initials are no longer generated via the `name`; instead specify a fallback with `<Avatar.Fallback>`

> TIP: To locate components, search your project by the v3 component name, such `<Avat...` for Avatar.

### Rename Components

As part of this update, select components have been renamed. Most now follow [Zag.js](https://zagjs.com/) naming conventions.
