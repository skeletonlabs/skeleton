## Mixing UI Libraries

Skeleton's design system is perfect for complementing headless component libraries, such as [Bits UI](/docs/headless/bits-ui), [Melt UI](/docs/headless/melt-ui), [Radix](/docs/headless/radix-ui), and [Zag.js](https://zagjs.com/). As well as "Tailwind component" libraries such as the [Tailwind Plus](https://tailwindcss.com/plus). Supporting any component system that supports Tailwind, but very specifically allows you to insert or substitute Skeleton-provided utility classes.

### Unsupported Libraries

Unfortunately, Skeleton cannot integrate with [Flowbite React](https://flowbite-react.com/), [Flowbite Svelte](https://flowbite-svelte.com/), or [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/) at this time. Similar to Skeleton, these libraries make changes to Tailwind that directly overlaps with many of our core features, including class names and color values.
