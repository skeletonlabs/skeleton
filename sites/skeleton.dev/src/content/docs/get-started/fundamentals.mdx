<p className="text-xl">
	Skeleton is comprised of three pillars - the design system, our extensions to Tailwind, and an optional suite of framework-specific
	components. Together these form a comprehensive solution for designing and implementing complex web interfaces at scale.
</p>

}

---

## Design System

### Figma UI Kit

A fully featured [Figma UI Kit](/figma) is available to designers, allowing them to quickly draft visual concept of your project.

### Iconography

Skeleton is icon agnostic, meaning you may bring your own iconography solution. However, we highly recommend [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) and utilize it for all examples in our documentation. Refer to our integration guides for [React](/docs/integrations/iconography/react) and [Svelte](/docs/integrations/iconography/svelte).

### Core Features

The following features fall under the umbrella of our design system. Provided via the Skeleton core.

<NavGrid collection="docs" path="design/" classes="md:grid-cols-2" />

---

## Tailwind

Tailwind components that act as primitives for creating complex interfaces. Provided via the Skeleton core.

<NavGrid collection="docs" path="tailwind/" classes="md:grid-cols-2" />

---

## Components

Skeleton also offers optional component packages for a number of select component frameworks. Each component automatically adapt to Skeleton's design system.

| Framework | NPM Package                     | Description                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| React     | `@skeletonlabs/skeleton-react`  | Contains all components and features for React.  |
| Svelte    | `@skeletonlabs/skeleton-svelte` | Contains all components and features for Svelte. |

### Powered by Zag.js

Skeleton's components are built on **Zag.js**, which provides a collection of framework-agnostic UI component patterns to manage logic and state. Zag was founded and maintained by industry veterans, such [Segun Adebayo](https://github.com/segunadebayo) - the creator and core maintainer for [Chakra UI](https://www.chakra-ui.com/).

### Importing Component

Import the component you wish to use from your framework package of choice, then insert it into your page template.

```ts
import { Avatar } from '@skeletonlabs/skeleton-{react|svelte}';
```

```svelte
<Avatar>...</Avatar>
```

### Composed Pattern

Skeleton components are explicit and granular. While a little more verbose, this offers direct access to all children within the tree, similar to working with raw HTML. Allowing the component to pass arbitrary props and attributes directly to the the template within. Including: `required`, `data-\*`, `style`, `class`, and more.

```svelte
<Avatar>
	<Avatar.Image src="https://i.pravatar.cc/150?img=48" />
	<Avatar.Fallback>SK</Avatar.Fallback>
</Avatar>
```

### Styling Components

Skeleton omponents utilize a universal convention for accepting utility classes via the standard `class` attribute.

```svelte
<Avatar class="rounded-2xl">
	<Avatar.Image src="https://i.pravatar.cc/150?img=48" class="greyscale" />
	<Avatar.Fallback>SK</Avatar.Fallback>
</Avatar>
```

By default, all internal default styles within the component are auto-prefixed to ensure they are assigned to the `@base` layer in the Tailwind bundle. This ensures your styles, provide through the `class` attribute, always take precedence.

```css
@custom-variant skb {
	@layer base {
		@slot;
	}
}
```

### Extensible Markup

Skeleton components provide a mechasism for overwriting the internal HTML with custom markup.

> NOTE: This is an optional feature aimed at advanced users that wish to have fine grain control over the display of their component-driven interfaces.

**React:**

```tsx
export default function () {
	return (
		<Accordion>
			{/* ... */}
			<Accordion.Item value="item-1">
				<Accordion.Heading>
					<Accordion.Trigger element={({ attributes }) => <button {...attributes}>My Own Button</button>} />
					<Accordion.Content>Content for Item 1</Accordion.Content>
				</Accordion.Heading>
			</Accordion.Item>
			{/* ... */}
		</Accordion>
	);
}
```

**Svelte:**

```svelte
<Accordion>
	<!-- ... -->
	<Accordion.Item value="item-1">
		<Accordion.Heading>
			<Accordion.Trigger>
				{#snippet element({ attributes })}
					<button {...attributes}>My Own Button</button>
				{/snippet}
			</Accordion.Trigger>
			<Accordion.Content>Content for Item 1</Accordion.Content>
		</Accordion.Heading>
	</Accordion.Item>
	<!-- ... -->
</Accordion>
```

### Custom Animations

Building on the extensible markup feature described above, this provides additional control when it comes to implementing custom animations.

```ts
import { slide } from 'svelte/transition';
```

```svelte
<Accordion>
	<!-- ... -->
	<Accordion.Item value="item-1">
		<Accordion.Heading>
			<Accordion.Trigger>Item 1</Accordion.Trigger>
			<Accordion.Content>
				{#snippet element({ attributes })}
					{#if attributes.hidden !== true}
						<div {...attributes} hidden={false} transition:slide={{ duration: 100 }}>Content 1</div>
					{/if}
				{/snippet}
			</Accordion.Content>
		</Accordion.Heading>
	</Accordion.Item>
	<!-- ... -->
</Accordion>
```

1. Implement the `element()` snippet to gain access to the `attributes`.
2. Spread the `attributes` to the custom element, a `<div>` in this example.
3. Override the `hidden` attribute to `false` to prevent it from showing/hiding the element too soon.
4. Add the `transition:slide` and configure your preferred options.
5. Then implement the wrapping `#if` block that triggers transitions when `attribute.hidden` is toggled.

While we showcase this with [Svelte Transitions]()https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/transition, you could also substitute with any viable alternative. Including [Motion](https://motion.dev/) or framework agnostic animation library such as [Animate.css](https://animate.style/).
