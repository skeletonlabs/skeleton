title: Migrate from v2
description: Learn how to migrate from Skeleton v2 to the latest release.
summary: Skeleton v3 represented a major overhaul to Skeleton. This includes a ground up rewrite of every feature in the library. Note that some portions of this guide will be automated, while others require manual intervention. This is not a trivial migration from prior versions, so please ensure you follow this guide very carefully. This guide will help you travese both the v3 and v4 updates.

import NavigationGrid from '@/components/ui/navigation-grid.astro';

## Prerequisites

While Skeleton v3 introduced support for multiple frameworks, we’ve historically only supported SvelteKit. As such, this guide is only intended for users migrating from Skeleton v2 and SvelteKit. If you you are coming from another meta-framework, this will be outside the scope of this guide. However, this may still provide a valuable insight to the primary objectives for the overall migration process.

### Create a Migration Branch

As always, we recommend you handle all migration changes on a dedicated feature branch. This ensures you can easily drop or revert changes if something goes wrong.

```bash
git checkout -b migration
```

### Prepare Your Skeleton App

Please make sure you have accounted for the following:

- Your app is running the latest release of Skeleton v2.x
- All critical dependencies have been updated (optional but recommended)
- Your app is in a fully functional state before you proceed

---

## Migrate Core Technologies

Skeleton is built atop a number of core technologies. These must be migrated individually before proceeding with the Skeleton-specific migration. Note that Svelte and Tailwind provide dedicated CLIs to help automate this process. Please ensure you adhere to their accompany migration guides linked below.

### Svelte v5

Migrate to the latest release of Svelte v5.

### SvelteKit v2

Migrate to the latest release of SvelteKit v2.

		SvelteKit v2 Migration &rarr;
	</a>
</figure>

### Tailwind v4

Before migrating to Tailwind v4, please follow these steps:

1. Remove the `skeleton` plugin from your `tailwind.config` file.
2. Rename your `app.postcss` or `app.pcss` to `app.css`.
3. Remove the `purgecss` (`vite-plugin-tailwind-purgecss`) vite plugin from your `vite.config` (if installed).

Migrate to the latest release of Tailwind v4.

> TIP: Having trouble running Tailwind's automated migration script due to `@apply`? Comment or remove the classes temporarily, run the migration CLI, then follow [these steps](/docs/[framework]/get-started/migrate-from-v2#replacing-apply) to adapt to use native CSS properties and Tailwind's new utilities. Ideally you should avoid the use of `@apply` going forward.

	</a>
</figure>

#### Migrate to the Tailwind Vite Plugin

Use the following steps to migrate to from PostCSS to the Vite plugin:

1. Delete `postcss.config.{js|mjs}`
2. Run `npm uninstall postcss` (skip if not present)
3. Run `npm uninstall @tailwindcss/postcss` (skip if not present)
4. Run `npm install @tailwindcss/vite`
5. Open your `vite.config` in the root of your project
6. Import the following at the top of the file: `import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'`
7. Finally, add the Vite plugin ABOVE your specific framework plugin:

```ts
plugins: [
	tailwindcss(),
	sveltekit(), // or svelte()
];
```

> TIP: Please ensure you've committed all pending changes before proceeding.

---

## Automated Migration

We’ve provided a dedicated migration script as part of the Skeleton CLI to help automate much of this process. First, migrate to handle Skeleton v3 changes:

```bash
npx skeleton migrate skeleton-3
```

Commit all pending changes. Then run the following to migrate for Skeleton v4 changes:

```bash
npx skeleton migrate skeleton-4
```

What WILL be migrated...

- Update all required `package.json` dependencies.
- Implement all required Skeleton imports in your global stylesheet `app.css`.
- Modify `data-theme` in `app.html` (if you’re using a Skeleton preset theme)
- Temporarily disable custom theme imports to allow for manual theme migration.
- Migrate all modified Skeleton utility classes (ex: `variant-*` to `preset-*`)
- Update all Skeleton imports throughout your entire project.
- Rename all relevant Skeleton components (as possible)
- Some Component imports will be pruned as they are no longer supported. We’ll cover these below.

What will NOT be migrated...

- Component structure and props will not be updated. Unfortunately there’s too many permutations.
- Most v2 Utility features will not be migrated (ex: popovers, code blocks, etc). See our recommendations below.

Make sure to consult your local Git Diff (difference) to compare what has been modified before progressing forward or committing these automated changes.

---

## Manual Migration

With automated migration complete, please follow the remaining manual migration steps. The following steps are not optional, and must be handled as part of the overall migration process.

### Update Stylesheet Imports

> NOTE: The Skeleton CLI may handle these specific changes for you.

The following migration steps apply to your global stylesheet (ex: `app.css`).

The `@source` rules for sourcing component styles have been replaced with simpler and more intuitive `@import` rules.

```css
@source '../node_modules/@skeletonlabs/skeleton-{framework}/dist'; /* [!code --] */
@import '@skeletonlabs/skeleton-{framework}'; /* [!code ++] */
```

In Skeleton v3 the canned [Preset styles](/docs/[framework]/design/presets) were split to an optional stylesheet to allow them to be opt-in. However, due to popular demand, these have now been merged back into the core package in Skeleton v4.

```css
@import '@skeletonlabs/skeleton/optional/presets'; /* [!code --] */
```

### Migrate Themes

#### For Preset Themes

Your preset theme should be automatically migrated by the CLI. If so, this process is complete.

#### For Custom Themes

1. Use the [Import feature](https://themes.skeleton.dev/themes/import) provided by the new Theme Generator.
2. Drag and Drop your v2 theme into the file upload field.
3. Your theme will be automatically converted to the newest format.
4. Update and modify any theme settings in the live preview.
5. Make sure to set a valid theme name in the right-hand panel.
6. Tap the “Code” tab to preview your generated theme code.
7. Copy the theme code, then following our [custom theme instructions](/docs/[framework]/design/themes#custom-themes).
8. Similar to preset themes, you will need to both register and set an active theme.

### Replace AppShell with Custom Layouts

Skeleton has sunset the ([troublesome](https://github.com/skeletonlabs/skeleton/issues/2383)) `<AppShell>` component in favor of user-defined custom layouts. We've provided a [Layouts](/docs/[framework]/guides/layouts) guide for replicating common page structures using only semantic HTML and Tailwind - no Skeleton specific features required.

### Migrating Components

Components have underwent a major overhaul in Skeleton v3. Given the sheer number of changes, we recommend you compare each component to it's current production documentation. We’ve highlighted a few of the key changes below:

- Changes to adopt the new [Svelte 5 APIs](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/v5-migration-guide) like runes, snippets, event handlers, etc.
- Changes to support [Zag.js](https://zagjs.com/), which serves as a foundation of our cross-framework components.
- Changes to the import path: `@skeletonlabs/skeleton-svelte`.
- Changes to the component name and/or structure (including sub-components)
- Changes based on newly introduces features and properties.
- Changes to adopt the new [component fundamentals](/docs/[framework]/get-started/fundamentals#functional-components).

Below is an example of migrating a single component - the Avatar in this case.

**Was (v2)**

```svelte
<Avatar src="https://i.pravatar.cc/150?img=48" />
```

**Now (v4)**

```svelte
<Avatar>
	<Avatar.Image src="https://i.pravatar.cc/150?img=48" alt="Jane Doe" />
	<Avatar.Fallback>SK</Avatar.Fallback>
</Avatar>
```

Here's how this was handled:

1. Consult the documentation for the [Avatar component](/docs/[framework]/framework-components/avatar)
2. The Skeleton migration CLI should have updated all component imports automatically.
3. The root component `<Avatar>` remains; remove `src` and other unsupported props.
4. Implement the new `<Avatar.Image>` child and pass the `src` path and `alt` text.
5. Implement the new `<Avatar.Fallback>` child and pass a fallback value, icon, image, etc.

Until your components are migrated to the new syntax and APIs they will cause errors when trying to run your local developement server. As such, we recommend using the following technique to hanlde this in a progressive manner:

1. Use your editor of choice to search for Skeleton components via the import path (`@skeletonlabs/skeleton`)
2. Comment out each component one-by-one until all are disabled.
3. Consider adding messages such as `<p>(avatar)</p>` as visible placeholders for components on each page.
4. Uncomment each component individually as you migrate it forward to the new syntax.
5. Once all components are migrated, you should no longer receive errors when running the dev server.

### Renamed Components in v3

As part of the Skeleton v3 update, several components were renamed to be more semantic.

| Name               | v2                                                          | v3                                                               | Notes                                                     |

### Renamed Components in v4

Then again as part of the Skeleton v4 update, select components were once again renamed. These now follow the [Zag.js](https://zagjs.com/) naming conventions, which serves as the permanent standard going forward.

| v3                  | v4                           | v4 Docs                                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<Modal>`           | `<Dialog>`                   | [View](/docs/[framework]/framework-components/dialog)            |
| `<Navigation.Bar>`  | `<Navigation layout="bar">`  | [View](/docs/[framework]/framework-components/navigation)        |

| `<Segment>`         | `<SegmentedControl>`         | [View](/docs/[framework]/framework-components/segmented-control) |
| `<Toaster>`         | `<Toast.Group>`              | [View](/docs/[framework]/framework-components/toast)             |

### Tailwind v4 Changes

Tailwind v4 represents a major update for Tailwind. We've detailed the most notable features as they may relate to your Skeleton project. Please consult the [Tailwind v4 announcement](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4) post for the full roster of changes.

- The `tailwing.config` has been removed in favor of [CSS-base configuration](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4#css-first-configuration) in your global stylesheet.
- Make sure you’re using the newest strategies for supporting [Dark Mode](/docs/[framework]/guides/mode).
- You are still required to implement the [Tailwind Forms Plugin](/docs/[framework]/tailwind-components/forms#prerequisites) to use Skeleton form elements.
- The Skeleton `data-theme` attribute has moved from `<body>` to `<html>`
- Themes colors are now stored in the [oklch format](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/oklch-in-css-why-quit-rgb-hsl), but optionally support any format.

### Replacing @apply

We strongly encourage you take this opportunity to move away from any usage of `@apply`. Tailwind has long since advocated against heavy use of this, and Tailwind v4 introduces new directives and functions that make this much easier to avoid. Here's a trivial example:

```css
/* Before */

.foo {
	@apply bg-surface-50-950 text-surface-950 dark:text-surface-50 p-4;
}
```

```css
/* After */

.foo {
	background-color: var(--color-surface-50-950);
	color: var(--color-surface-950);
	padding: --spacing(4);
	@variant dark {
		color: var(--color-surface-50);
	}
}
```

- Usage of `@apply` may be found in your global stylesheet or component `<style>` blocks.
- Refer to the Skeleton [Core API](/docs/[framework]/get-started/core-api) documentation for a full list of Skeleton's CSS custom properties.
- Refer to the Tailwind's [functions and directives](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives) for information on how to utilize these new features.

### Replace Unsupported Features

Skeleton v3 represented a point of reflection on what features should remain as part of the core experience. As such, we identified a number of features that fall outside of this scope. Don't fret though, we've gone out of our way to detail each feature and provide the best alternative available.

#### Svelte Actions

| Name       | v2                                                 | Alternative                                            | Notes                                  |

### Migrate Input Groups

Although the automated migration script will handle the majority of class updates, [Input Groups](/docs/[framework]/tailwind-components/forms#groups) and the exception and will need to be migrated manually. See the new documentation page for updated examples.

| Old Class             | New Class  |
| --------------------- | ---------- |
| `input-group-shim`    | `ig-cell`  |
| `input-group > input` | `ig-input` |
| `input-group-divider` | (removed)  |

### Migration Complete

If you’ve completed all steps above in full, your application should once again be in a function state. Run your application's local dev server to confirm. Remember to merge all changes into your primary branch.

```bash
npm run dev
```
