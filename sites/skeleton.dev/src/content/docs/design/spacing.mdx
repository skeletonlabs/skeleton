## How It Works

In legacy versions of Skeleton, this was implement using custom mechanisms. However, starting Skeleton `v3.0.0` and Tailwind `4.0.0`, this now utilizes the official [Tailwind Spacing](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4#dynamic-utility-values-and-variants) property.

```css
@layer theme {
	:root {
		--spacing: 0.25rem;
	}
}
```

With the added benefit this can be easily customized per Skeleton theme.

```css
[data-theme='cerberus'] {
	--spacing: 0.25rem;
}
```

## Supported Properties

The scaling system supports all relevant Tailwind utility classes, including, but not limited to:

`padding`, `margin`, `width`, `minWidth`, `maxWidth`, `height`, `minHeight`, `maxHeight`, `gap`, `inset`, `space`, `translate`
