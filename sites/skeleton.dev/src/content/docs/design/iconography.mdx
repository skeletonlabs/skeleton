import { TriangleIcon, HeartIcon, UserRoundIcon } from '@lucide/svelte';

## Lucide

<figure class="linker bg-noise">
	<div class="flex gap-4">
		<HeartIcon class="size-12" />
		<UserRoundIcon class="size-12" />
		<TriangleIcon class="size-12" />
	</div>
</figure>

While Skeleton does not bundle an official icon library, we highly recommend the use of [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/). This provides a huge selection of icons that are available to all popular frameworks, and features a clean and modern aesthetic. All code examples provided through the Skeleton documentation website implement **Lucide**, but feel free to replace with any alternative.
