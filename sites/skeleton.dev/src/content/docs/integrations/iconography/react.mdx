import { TriangleIcon, HeartIcon, UserRoundIcon } from 'lucide-react';

<p class="text-xl">
	Skeleton takes an agnostic approach to icons, meaning you can use any combination of SVGs, emoji, unicode, or dedicated icon libraries.
	Mix and match to fulfill your project's unique requirements.

	<div class="flex gap-4">
		<HeartIcon size={48} />
		<UserRoundIcon size={48} />
		<TriangleIcon size={48} />
	</div>
</figure>
