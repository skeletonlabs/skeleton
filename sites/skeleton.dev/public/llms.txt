# Skeleton Documentation for LLMs

> Skeleton provides a uniform design language and structured framework for controlling the look and feel of your product and user experience. It serves as an opinionated design system that aims to greatly reduce the amount of time spent managing design elements and patterns, allowing you to more quickly build and manage your frontend interfaces at scale.


## Documentation Sets

- [React package documentation](https://skeleton.dev/llms-react.txt): documentation with React specific examples.
- [Svelte package documentation](https://skeleton.dev/llms-svelte.txt): documentation with Svelte specific examples.

## Notes
- The content is automatically generated from the official documentation
- Skeleton's core features are framework agnostic, only requiring the use of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). This provides full access to all design system features, while enabling you to standardize the design process for your framework of choice.
